<h1>Frequently Asked Questions(FAQs)</h1>

<h3>Overview</h3>
This is my second react project. The first one was a <a href="https://github.com/yawcoder/react-navbar">navigation bar</a>. This project is a simple accordion containing normal FAQs but with a little twist. The questions have been divided into categories.

<h3>Features</h3>
When you open a live view of this project, you should see two sections. One on the left and one the right(one up and one below when viewing on mobile). The left section is a list of all the categories. Clicking any of them will reveal its questions on the right.

<h3>Stack</h3>
<ul>
    <li>React Using Vite</li>
    <li>TailwindCSS</li>
    <li>Questions and answers was generated with ChatGPT</li>
</ul>
